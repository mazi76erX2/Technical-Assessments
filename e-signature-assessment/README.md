# 🖊️ Mini E-Signature Flow – Technical Assessment

Welcome! This short assessment is designed to evaluate your ability to work across a modern full-stack web application. You'll be creating a simple document upload and signing workflow using Angular and Python.

---

## 🎯 Objective

This assessment should take you about 2 hours.

Build a minimal e-signature flow that allows a user to:

1. Upload a PDF file via a web interface.
2. Send the file to a Python backend.
3. "Sign" the document (simulate this with metadata).
4. Save the signed file locally on the backend (no cloud storage needed).
5. Display a success message and signing metadata in the frontend.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 🔧 Backend

Run the backend Flask server:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 🧩 Frontend
In another terminal, start the Angular app:
```bash
cd frontend
ng serve
```

## 🛠️ What You Need to Implement

**Frontend (Angular)**
Add an HTML form with:

- A file input for selecting a PDF
- A button to upload the file to the backend
- Send the selected file using a POST request to `/upload`
- Display a response with:
  - Filename
  - Timestamp (when it was "signed")
- Add comments to your code where applicable

💡 You'll find the Angular app already scaffolded in `frontend/src/app`.

**Backend (Python + Flask)**
The backend has a `/upload` endpoint ready to receive files. You should:

- Accept the uploaded file
- Simulate a "sign" by:
  - Appending signing metadata (e.g., timestamp)
  - Saving the file locally in a `signed_docs/` directory
- Return a JSON response with the filename and timestamp

📝 You do not need to implement real cryptographic signing. Just simulate it in a simple way.

## 🧪 Example Flow
1. User selects `contract.pdf`
2. User clicks "Sign & Upload"
3. Frontend sends the file to `/upload`
4. Backend saves a file like `signed_docs/contract-signed.pdf`
5. Response is shown in the UI:

```json
{
  "message": "File signed",
  "metadata": {
    "filename": "contract.pdf",
    "signed_at": "2025-06-24T12:03:00Z"
  }
}
```

## ✅ Notes
- CORS is already enabled in the backend to allow communication from Angular.
- The focus is on code clarity, communication between frontend and backend, and good structure — not pixel-perfect design or auth.
